# Discord Presence

Allows you to see which song you're playing along with other info while playing beat saber on the oculus quest.

## Installation
The mod integrates with a PC client and quest app by [MadMagic](https://github.com/madmagic007). **Before installing the mod**, you must follow the instructions on his github page (or the youtube tutorial) to install the app on your PC and sideload the APK: https://github.com/madmagic007/Oculus-Quest-Presence 

**Note**: The app by him enables basic rich presence for any quest app, this is why it runs on the quest.

After following the steps above, you can then install the mod in BMBF (download below). Now it should all be working.
The mod also has a config file, which you can edit if you wish to change the format of your presence. The default config file is attached for you to edit and then upload to BMBF. Editing the config is not necessary to use the mod.
