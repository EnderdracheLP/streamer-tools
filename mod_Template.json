Also check all the other nice mods the Beat Saber community has done. And I can just tell you to buy a Quest 1 as it's black and if you don't want black then you should probably get a quest 2. However don't disable dark mode as that's gonna burn your eyes. Can we paste a wikipedia article here? Let's see... Btw if you don't like that Ender then revert it. But anyways let's continue. I was kinda bored so I played some Smash and now I feel way better and can commit this commit. :)",
